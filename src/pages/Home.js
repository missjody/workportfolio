          <h2 id="gradFont">In April 2020 I graduated from the University of Denverâ€™s
          Full Stack program, which covered HTML, CSS, JS, and React.
          I also gained experience in setting up databases and servers to connect
          to front-end, including MongoDB, Mongoose, and Express.
          Outside of class I explored additional technologies: Adobe Xd,
          Green Sock animation, Materialize CSS, Sass and ChartJS.
