### Todos

* Update to multiple pages (routing) 

Error: Element type is invalid: expected a string (for built-in components) or a class/function (for composite components) but got: object.

Check the render method of `App`.

"You're exporting a React element, not a component.. Changed to class App extends Component and exported"
