Hovering over a project gives a short description of the project. Once completed, clicking on the project image will display a modal with links and a longer description of the project.

Worked through this tutorial for modals in react: https://github.com/AlbertCarreras/modal_example

* Modified to allow for more than one modal on page, creating content inside each modal

* Change from case switch to something more elegant
