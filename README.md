* Now that it is set up for spa routing there is an answer for going to individual project's pages but there is not a way to return to the "home" page to retrieve the contact information.
    * Solutions could be adding a button to return or could be that Projects also includes the About component.

~~  Change from modals to routing to individual pages ~~ 
~~    With the SPA sat up next is redirection on click to page for project, rendering with passed project's info ~~

* Finish UI for individual project

* Add some PIZZAZ animations

* Push updates to live site

Hovering over a project gives a short description of the project. Once completed, clicking on the project image will display a modal with links and a longer description of the project.

Worked through this tutorial for modals in react: https://github.com/AlbertCarreras/modal_example

* Modified to allow for more than one modal on page, creating content inside each modal

* Change from case switch to something more elegant
